# Combined CDN Request for Telerik Controls

The Telerik scripts CDN can be optimized to request a single file that contains all the scripts for all the controls from the UI for ASP.NET AJAX suite (**Examples 1-2**).

This resource combination will result in a single request for the Telerik controls scripts on each page that can be cached aggressively by the browser, as opposed to a number of different files that may not all be already cached. While this file will usually be larger than the sum of all individual files for an average page, if the end user downloads it once, they will get it from the browser cache for all pages in your application that have this setting enabled.

>caption **Example 1**: Enable combined script resource for the Telerik controls for the entire application in the web.config.

````XML
<configuration>
    <appSettings>
        <add key="Telerik.ScriptManager.TelerikCdn.CombinedResource" value="Enabled" />
    </appSettings>
</configuration>
````

You can see the rest of the settings you can set globally via appSettings keys in the [web.config Settings Overview](/general-information/web-config-settings-overview#control-properties-you-can-set-from-the-webconfig) article.

>caption **Example 2**: Enable combined script resource for the Telerik controls for a concrete page in the markup.

````ASP.NET
<telerik:RadScriptManager ID="RadScriptManager1" runat="server">
	<CdnSettings TelerikCdn="Enabled" CombinedResource="Enabled" />
</telerik:RadScriptManager>
````
